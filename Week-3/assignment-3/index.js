// Output:- Count is 0
/* The function increment() was called three time which increased count to a value of 3
message variable is in the function createIncrement() whose initial value is count is 0
even if the variable count has increased many time the variable message always matters count is 0
log() a closure that grabs the message variable from scope createIncrement()
console.log(message) writes down 'Count is 0' to the console.*/
